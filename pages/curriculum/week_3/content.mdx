# Week 3: More CSS - Animation and Selectors

---

## Introduction

This week, we're diving deeper into CSS, exploring formatting, animations and selectors. We'll learn how to make our web page more eye-catching and interactive.

---

## Starting with formatting

We left off last week with a vertical stack of products
![vertical stack of products](/images/stack-of-products.png "stack of products")

and the goal is for them to be aligned in a row

For this we will use display: flex. The details won't be covered in this course since flexbox is a deeper subject and we only need this one line of code: `display: flex` to align the products in a row.

## What are CSS Animations?

Animations make it possible to transition from one CSS style to another. They're a way to have fun and engage users on your webpage!

## Why are animations important?

They're fun. That's the best reason. Fun to make, fun to look at. They can create a more alive and interesting website.

## Basic Animation Example

![color changing animation example](/images/color-changing-animation.gif "color changing animation example")

```css
@keyframes example {
  0% {
    background-color: red;
  }
  50% {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: green;
  }
}

div {
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}
```

<iframe

  height="432"

  frameborder="0"
  scrolling="no"
  allow="fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

## What are CSS Selectors?

Selectors are how we pick which element to apply styles to. We've already learned some of them. We can select elements based on their name, id, and more!

Let's introduce 2 new selectors: hovered and clicked on components.

---

## Basic Selector Example

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}

p:hover {
  color: green;
}
```

This CSS will make all paragraph text blue, and when hovered on, the text will turn green

  width="768"
  height="432"

  frameborder="0"
  scrolling="no"
  allow="fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

## Why are selectors important?

Selectors give us the power to style specific elements on our page.

They also allow us to apply effects only when a component is clicked or hovered on. This introduces visual feedback to our website, which creates a feeling of interaction for the user.

## Conclusion

With CSS animations and selectors we can create dynamic, interactive, and visually appealing web pages.

Keep exploring and experimenting with different styles and animations. ChatGPT can be a great resource for discovering if a certain effect or style is possible. And codepen.io has lots of beautiful animated css examples. Happy coding!
