- don't forget to fork!
- during live coding session, ask students to do the following challenges

  1. create a string variable and log it as well as its type
  2. create a number variable and log it as well as its type
  3. add two number variables together and guess what the output is then log the output to check
  4. concatenate two string variables and guess what the output is then log the output to check
  5. create an array and log it

- invitation to explore deeper:
  - what are other types of variables that can be created?
    - e.g. arrays, objects, booleans
