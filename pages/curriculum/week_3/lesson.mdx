# Week 3: Build the Cart Layout

## Today you’ll build...

The **shopping cart section** of your page. This is where selected items will appear later.

You’ll create:

- A "Your Cart" heading
- A placeholder message that says "Your cart is empty"
- A container that will eventually hold items
- A section to show the total price

This gives your cart a place to grow as you add interactivity in later weeks.

---

## To do that, you’ll learn...

- How to use semantic HTML to create sections of a page
- How to organize your HTML into meaningful areas
- How to use:

  - `<header>`, `<section>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`, `<p>`, `<div>`

- How to create placeholders for future content
- How to apply class names to prepare for styling

---

## By the end of today...

Each student will add a **cart section** to their `index.html`, including:

```html
<section>
  <h2 class="section-title">Your Cart</h2>
  <div class="cart-container">
    <p class="empty-cart" id="empty-cart-message">Your cart is empty.</p>
    <ul class="cart-items" id="cart-items"></ul>
    <div class="cart-total" id="cart-total"></div>
  </div>
</section>
```

And basic layout styles like:

```css
.cart-container {
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 80%;
  max-width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  text-align: left;
}
```

## Instructor Notes

### Setup

- Students should open their existing project and locate the end of the `<main>` section
- Instructor demo should:

  - Add a new `<section>` for the cart
  - Walk through each element: heading, message, list, total container
  - Explain use of `id` and `class` for future JavaScript and CSS

### Instructor Live Coding Goals

- Reinforce structure and readability of HTML
- Help students nest elements properly (e.g., `<ul>` inside a container `<div>`)
- Emphasize this is setup — it won't _do_ anything yet

### 1:1 Mentor Goals

- Every student adds a cart section with correct structure
- Students match class names and IDs exactly for consistency
- If ahead: begin styling the cart container with padding, borders, etc.

### Wrap-up and What’s Next

Reinforce:

- Today’s work sets up a “home” for items once the cart becomes interactive
- You now have a visible cart section on the page

Preview:

> “Next week, we’ll add real products using JavaScript — instead of copy/paste, the product cards will be generated for you.”
