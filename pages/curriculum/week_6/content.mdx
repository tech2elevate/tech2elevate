## Week 6: DOM, If/Else, Array Methods, Boolean Variables, Comparison Operators

## DOM - Document Object Model

![DOM model](/images/DOM-image.png "DOM model")

- When a webpage loads, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
- The DOM is the blueprint of a webpage, constructed as a tree of objects.

#### Accessing and Storing HTML Elements

- To make changes, we need:

  1. To access the document object.

  2. Then access the specific HTML element we want.

Variables can store HTML Tags!

- We’ve learned that variables can store any value we put inside of them

- This includes numbers and strings.…but can also include HTML tags!

- When we save HTML tags in variables, we can then manipulate,or change, the HTML (and CSS!) through JavaScript

- We can select HTML elements three different ways:

1.  HTML element/tag name

2.  A period and their class (.)

3.  A hashtag and their id (#)

Overall example:

![querySelector model](/images/querySelector-img.png "querySelector model")

## Conditional Statements : If/Else

- Conditional statements allow different things happen based on different situations in websites and apps.
- We often want to perform different actions for different conditions or situations.

- If Keyword - Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Else Keyword - Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Condition - A condition is between the ( ) and the result should be true or false.

Real World/Code Along Examples:

- If it’s raining outside 🌧️ → I bring an umbrella ☂️
  Else → I bring sunglasses 🕶️
- If travel time > 1 hour ⏳ → I read a book 📖
  Else → I listen to music 🎶
- If it’s a weekday 🗓️ → I go to sleep at 10pm 😴
  Else → I stay up and play video games 🎮

## Array Methods

#### Recap: What is an Array?

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
```

- An array is a data structure that can store multiple values in a single variable.

- Arrays are like containers that hold a list of items.

- Each item in an array is called an element. Elements are ordered and can be accessed using a numerical index (index starts at 0 for the first element, 1 for the second, and so on).

#### Array Methods

- Array methods are built-in functions that allow us to perform various operations on arrays easily.

- Some common array methods:
  push() ,
  pop() ,
  shift() ,
  unshift() ,
  splice() ...

##### Array Method: push()

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

fruits.push("grapes"); // ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grapes']
```

- The push() method adds elements to the end of an array.

```javascript
let fruits = [];

 2 let favFruit = "mango"

 3 fruits.push(favFruit); // ['mango']
```

- You can also pass a variable through .push() and add elements to an empty array.

##### Array Method: pop()

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

fruits.pop(); // ['apple', 'banana']
```

- The pop() method removes the last element from an array.

##### Array Method: splice()

```javascript
Array.splice(index, remove_count, item_list);
```

- index: It is a required parameter. This parameter is the index from which the modification of the array starts (with the origin at 0). This can be negative also, which begins after many elements counting from the end.
- remove_count: The number of elements to be removed from the starting index.
- items_list: The list of new items separated by a comma operator that is to be inserted from the starting index.

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

// At position 2, add 2 elements:
fruits.splice(2, 0, "Lemon", "Kiwi"); // ['Banana', 'Orange', 'Lemon', 'Kiwi', 'Apple', 'Mango']
```

- The splice() method is an inbuilt method in JavaScript that is used to change the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements. It modifies the original array and returns an array of the removed elements.

## Boolean Variables

```javascript
let student1 = true;
let student2 = false;
```

- Boolean is a datatype that returns either of two values i.e. true or false.
- In JavaScript, Boolean is used as a function to get the value of a variable, object, conditions, expressions, etc. in terms of true or false.

## Comparison Operators

- Comparison operators are used to test for true or false.

- Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

```javascript
== //equal to

===	//equal value and equal type

!=	//not equal

!==	//not equal value or not equal type

>	//greater than

<	//less than

>=	//greater than or equal to

<=	//less than or equal to
```

For example, we will use x = 5, the table below explains the comparison operators:
