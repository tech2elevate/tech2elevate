# Week 2 Content

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

- The purpose of CSS is to style and layout webpages

- To add the css file to the html file you want to style use the `<link>` tag

  `<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> `

  - This tag is added within the `<head> </head>` tag
  - `href=` provides the location of the document
  - `rel=` provides the relationship between the current document and external resource
  - `types=` specifies the media type of the linked document

- Id selector

  - Allows to identify a single element in the html code
  - Each element can only have one id and each page can only have one element with that id
  - Create the the id the html file

    `<div id="idname" > </div>`

  - Select an Id in the css file by using `#` followed by the id

        ```css
          #idname {
            Define properties here
          }
        ```

- Class selector

  - Classes can be assigned to multiple elements, therefore, reusable
  - Create a class by using the `.` followed by the name of the class

    ```css
     .class-name {
       Define properties here
     }
    ```

  - Use the class in the html file

    `<p class="class-name"> </p>`

- Styles

  - Color

        - For text use the `color` property
        - For the background use the `background-color` property
        - For the border use the `border-color` property
        ```css
          .class-name {
            color: green; // makes the text green
            background-color: red; // makes the background of the element red
            border-color: black; // makes the border of the element black
          }
        ```

  - Border

    - Use `border` to choose the style and thickness of the border for the element

      ```css
      .solid-thin {
        border: thin solid;
      }
      .dashed-medium {
        border: medium dashed;
      }
      .dotted-thick {
        border: thick dotted;
      }
      ```

  - Padding

    - Padding is the amount of space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders
      ![box model](/images/box-model.png "box model")
    - Use `padding` property to set the padding to all four sides of the element
      ```css
      .padding {
        padding: 25px;
      }
      ```
    - The following properties can be used to speficy padding on a certain side of the element

      ```css
      .padding {
        padding-top: 25px;
        padding-right: 50px;
        padding-bottom: 75px;
        padding-left: 15px;
      }
      ```

  - Margin

    - Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders
    - Use `margin` to set the margin to all four sides
      ```css
      .margin {
        margin: 25px;
      }
      ```
    - The following properties can be used to speficy the margin on a certain side of the element

      ```css
      .margin {
        margin-top: 25px;
        margin-right: 50px;
        margin-bottom: 75px;
        margin-left: 15px;
      }
      ```

  - Width

    - Use the property `width` to set the width of the element in pixels or percentage

      ```css
        .element {
          width: 500px; // sets the width to 500 pixels
          width: 50%; // sets the width of the element to 50% of the parent element
        }

      ```

  - Fonts

    - To select a font for text use the `font-family` property
    - Select the font size by using the `font-size` property
    - `font-style` property can be used to style the font normal, italic, or oblique
    - Select the thicnkess of the font by using `font-weight` property
      - choose between: normal, bold, bolder, lighter

    ```css
      element {
        font-family: Courier New;  // selected font is Courier New
        font-style: italic; // makes the font italic
        font-size: 15px; // sets fonts szie to 15 pixels
        font-weight: bold; // bolds the font
     }
    ```
