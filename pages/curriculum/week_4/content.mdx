# Intro to JavaScript (Lesson 4)

### Purpose of JavaScript

- JavaScript is a web development language
- Adds functionality to the page:
  - user interaction
  - display data
  - load content on a page

#### Add a JavaScript file to HTML file

- Add the script tag to the HTML file within the `<head>` element

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

- This links the JavaScript file to the html file.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Make sure the `src` value is correct.
</Callout>

#### Log hello world

- `console.log()` is a tool that developers often use for testing and debugging
- like checking your work in math class
- allows you to see what your code is doing
- also a quick way to verify that JS and HTML files are hooked up

```javascript
console.log("hello world");
```

### Variables

#### Create variables using let and const & assign them values

- `let` and `const` are key words letting JavaScript know you are writing a variable
- `let` is a variable that you can can re-assign

```javascript
let cat;
cat = "Clara";
console.log(cat);
cat = "Jorge";
console.log(cat);
```

- `const` is a variable that you cannot can re-assign
- first you `declare` a variable
- then you `assign` the variable a value

```javascript
// declaration or declaring the variable
let cat;
// assignment or assigning a value to the variable
cat = "Tabby";
```

- to check to see what the output is, we will console log this variable

```javascript
console.log("cat:", cat);
```

- what would happen if we didn't assign a value to the variable?

```javascript
let pet;
console.log("pet:", pet);
```

- generally, we will want to use `const`
- declared and assigned in the same line

```javascript
const dog = "Ronnie";
console.log("dog:", dog);
```

#### Identify words that cannot be used for variable naming

- in JavaScript (and other languages) there are certain words that you cannot use as variable names
- these are called `reserved keywords`
- such as:
  - class
  - const
  - let
  - if
  - typeof
  - this
- see here for a full list: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp

### Types of variables

- variables can hold different types of data such as numbers, or strings (like words)
- knowing the data type allows us to operate on variables, like add two numbers together
- there are 8 data types in JavaScript (read more here: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp)
- we will focus on 4
  - `string`
  - `number`
  - special type of object called `array`
  - `object`

#### Create a string variable

- we've already done this!
- to create a string variable, declare the variable and assign it to a string
- a string is a value with "quotes" around it

```javascript
const word = "hello";
console.log("word:", word);
```

- to double check the type of this variable you can try

```javascript
console.log("type of word is:", typeof word);
```

### Challenge 1:

```
TODO:
Create a string variable and log it as well as its type
```

#### Create a number variable

- same process as string, expect no quotes and it must be a number

```javascript
const count = 2;
console.log("count:", count);
```

### Challenge 2:

```
TODO:
Create a number variable and log it as well as its type
```

### Advanced

#### Use arithmetic operators

- you can combine variables in different ways
- with numbers, just like in math, you can add, subtract, multiply, divide
- a common use case is counting the number of times something happens
- you can assign a variable to itself plus a number

```javascript
let numberOfLikes = 3;
console.log("number of likes:", numberOfLikes);
numberOfLikes = numberOfLikes + 4;
console.log("number of likes:", numberOfLikes);
```

### Challenge 3:

```
TODO:
Concatenate two string variables and guess what the output is then log the output to check
```

- you can also "add" strings
- this is called concatenation

```javascript
const firstName = "Alexandra";
const lastName = "Rodriguez-Beuerman";
const fullName = firstName + lastName;
console.log("full name:", fullName);
```

### Challenge 4:

```
TODO:
Add two number variables together and guess what the output is then log the output to check
```

#### Create and implement arrays

- arrays are a set or list of values
- could be of a single data type or multiple types
- declared with `let` or `const` just like we've been doing
- assigned values within `[]`

```javascript
const animals = ["dog", "cat", "mouse"];
console.log("animals", animals);
```

### Challenge 5:

```
TODO:
Create an array and log it
```

#### Objects

A more complex data type over strings and numbers are <b>objects</b>. Objects allow you to group related data and functionality together, making it easier to organize and manage code.

You declare and assign a value, just like we did previously with variables, but we use what are called curly braces to denote that this is an object

```javascript
const car = {};
console.log("car:", car);
```

##### Why Use Objects?

- Objects are useful when you have more complex data
- Often we want data that represents things in the real world
  - For example, like a car
- Cars have different attributes, like: color, type, number of doors, etc.
- We can use objects to describe these attributes using something called `key-value pairs`
- Objects have the flexibility of using multiple `data types`, meaning it can have numbers, strings, and more!
  - They can become very complex because you can even have an object within an object!

```javascript
const car = {
  color: "black",
};
console.log("car:", car);
```

In the example above:

- color is the `key`
- black is the `value`

You can assign multiple key-value pairs to an object

```javascript
const sedan = {
  color: "black",
  make: "lexus",
  year: 2007,
  numberOfDoors: 4,
};
console.log("sedan:", sedan);
```

- Notice how the `color` and `make` keys are strings and `year` and `numberOfDoors` are numbers values

The examples above simply <b>creates</b> an object called `sedan`. To access the key-value pairs, you must:

- Use the object variable name (in this case sedan) followed by the `.` character and then any existing key name in the object

```javascript
console.log("the color of the sedan is:", sedan.color);
console.log("the make of the sedan is:", sedan.make);
console.log("the year of the sedan is:", sedan.year);
console.log("the sedan has this many doors:", sedan.numberOfDoors);
```

Lastly, now that we know create objects and access key-value pairs of objects, we should learn how to set and add values to objects after creation

Very similar to how you would as a variable, you can do the same with objects!

```javascript
sedan.color = "Orange";
sedan.year = 2020;
console.log("sedan:", sedan);
```

- Notice how all other key-value pairs in the sudan object remain the same if they are not modified

To add key-value pairs, "set" a value on a key that doesn't exist in the object already

```javascript
sedan.topSpeed = 160;
console.log("sedan:", sedan);
```

### Challenge 6:

```
TODO:
Create a new Person object that describes at least 3 characteristics about yourself. Print out your object using console.log
```
