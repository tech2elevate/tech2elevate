# Week 4: Generate Product Cards with JavaScript

## Today you’ll build...

A **dynamic product list** using JavaScript. Instead of writing each product card by hand in HTML, your JavaScript code will generate them automatically from a list of products.

This is your first step toward making the cart interactive.

---

## To do that, you’ll learn...

- How to link a JavaScript file to your HTML
- How to create an object
- How to create a function
- How to write a product array using objects
- How to access elements on the page with `document.getElementById`
- How to use `innerHTML` to insert HTML using JavaScript
- How to use `.forEach()` to loop through your products

---

## By the end of today...

Each student will:

- Define a list of products in JavaScript
- Use JavaScript to create and display product cards on the page
- Replace hardcoded product cards from Week 1 with ones generated by code

### Example:

```js
// To simplify, could start with 1 product
const products = [
  {
    name: "Minecraft - Xbox One",
    price: 29.99,
    image: "https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_780d12cc...",
  },
  // Add more products...
];

// TODO: does not have to be function but it can a stretch goal
function createProductHTML(product) {
  // need to add id/data to button
  return `
    <img src="${product.image}" alt="${product.name}" class="product-image">
    <h2>${product.name}</h2>
    <p>$${product.price.toFixed(2)}</p>
    <button class="add-to-cart-button">Add to Cart</button>
  `;
}

function displayProducts() {
  const productList = document.getElementById("product-list");
  products.forEach((product) => {
    const productCard = document.createElement("div");
    productCard.classList.add("product-card");
    productCard.innerHTML = createProductHTML(product);
    productList.appendChild(productCard);
  });
}

displayProducts();
```

## Instructor Notes

### Setup

- Students should have:

  - `index.html` with a `<div id="product-list" class="product-grid"></div>` replacing their old hardcoded cards
  - `script.js` file linked properly in their HTML (placed before closing `</body>` tag)

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

### Instructor Live Coding Goals

- Define a `products` array with at least 2–3 objects
- Show how to loop through and render cards inside `#product-list`
- Separate card layout logic into a helper function (`createProductHTML`)

### 1:1 Mentor Goals

- Every student removes their hardcoded HTML product cards
- Every student successfully loads product cards via JavaScript
- Debug common issues:

  - HTML element not found due to wrong `id`
  - `innerHTML` typos
  - Not calling the display function

### Wrap-up and What’s Next

Reinforce:

- JavaScript helps you generate and control content, not just style it
- Your site can now display **any number of products** from one list

Preview:

> “Next week, you’ll make the Add to Cart button work — clicking it will actually add an item to your cart.”
