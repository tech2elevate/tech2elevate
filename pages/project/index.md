# ðŸ›’ The Target Shopping Cart

During the 8-week program, the students will be required to build a simple shopping cart using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Here is an example of the Shopping Cart, but we will encourage students to create their own version of it and have fun experimenting with styles.
