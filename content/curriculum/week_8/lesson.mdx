# Week 8: Polish and Personalize Your Cart

## Today you’ll build...

Your **final version** of the shopping cart. You’ll clean up your code, improve the look and feel, and add personal touches to make the project your own.

This is your chance to take everything you’ve learned and finish strong.

---

## To do that, you’ll review and apply...

- HTML structure and semantics
- CSS styling and layout
- JavaScript logic and DOM updates
- Event listeners and array manipulation
- Clean code practices: naming, indentation, clarity

---

## By the end of today...

Each student will:

- Have a fully working shopping cart that includes:
  - Product list generated from JavaScript
  - Working “Add to Cart” and “Remove” buttons
  - Quantity tracking and total price

- Personalize their cart with one or more changes, such as:
  - New product list
  - Custom color scheme or fonts
  - Additional CSS polish (e.g. hover states, borders, spacing)
  - Logo or header text

## Instructor Notes

### Setup

- No new files needed. Students use their full project from Weeks 1–7.
- Encourage backing up a version before making final changes.

### Instructor Live Walkthrough Ideas

- Clean up indentation and spacing
- Use consistent naming for classes and variables
- Add CSS polish (e.g. better padding, button hover styles)
- Suggest: change fonts, colors, product images, or headings

### 1:1 Mentor Goals

- Help students polish code and styling
- Encourage at least one creative customization
- If ahead:
  - Add cart empty state styling
  - Try different product categories
  - Center layout responsively

### Wrap-up and What’s Next

Reinforce:

- You now have a complete web project with real structure, logic, and design
- You’ve used real developer tools and practices

Preview:

> “Next time we meet, it’s **Demo Day**. You’ll be walking others through your shopping cart — what it does, what you added, and what you’re proud of. This is your chance to show off all your hard work.”

Encourage:

- Clean presentation of features
- Mentioning one thing they learned or enjoyed building
- Optional: giving their cart a name or brand

Final message:

> “You built a full web app from scratch — that’s no small thing. This is how real web developers start, and you’re already doing it.”
