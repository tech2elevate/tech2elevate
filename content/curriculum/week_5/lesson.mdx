# Week 6: Track Quantity and Show Total Price

## Today you’ll build...

A smarter cart that:

- **Tracks quantities** when a user adds the same item more than once
- **Calculates the total price** of all items in the cart

Your shopping cart will now reflect a real purchase experience.

---

## To do that, you’ll learn...

- How to update quantities instead of adding duplicate items
- How to calculate a running total
- How to use:
  - `.find()` to look for items in the cart
  - Basic math operations
  - `toFixed(2)` for formatting dollar values

- How to keep the DOM in sync with the cart data

---

## By the end of today...

Each student will:

- See quantity increase when the same item is added again
- View a total price displayed in the cart area

### Example (cart view):

```
Minecraft - Qty: 2 - $59.98
Sour Patch Kids - Qty: 1 - $1.29
Total: $61.27
```

### Code snippets:

```js
function updateCart() {
  cartItemsContainer.innerHTML = "";

  let total = 0;

  cart.forEach((item) => {
    const itemTotal = item.price * item.quantity;
    total += itemTotal;

    const cartItem = document.createElement("li");
    cartItem.innerHTML = `
      <span>${item.name}</span>
      <span>Qty: ${item.quantity}</span>
      <span>$${itemTotal.toFixed(2)}</span>
    `;
    cartItemsContainer.appendChild(cartItem);
  });

  cartTotalContainer.innerHTML = `<h2>Total: $${total.toFixed(2)}</h2>`;
}
```

## Instructor Notes

### Setup

- Students should already have:
  - A `cart` array that stores item name, price, and quantity
  - A way to render cart items
  - A section (`#cart-total`) for displaying the total

### Instructor Live Coding Goals

- Walk through how to update `quantity` instead of pushing a new item
- Show how to calculate and update the total dynamically
- Discuss how the cart and UI stay in sync every time `updateCart()` runs

### 1:1 Mentor Goals

- Every student sees quantity increase for repeated clicks
- Every student sees total update in real time
- If ahead:
  - Style the cart layout
  - Show dollar signs and format all prices

### Wrap-up and What’s Next

Reinforce:

- Your cart now reflects quantities and cost — a big milestone
- You’re managing dynamic data and updating the UI

Preview:

> “Next week, we’ll add a **remove** button so users can take items out of their cart.”
