# Week 2: Build a Product Card with HTML

## Today you’ll build...

A **product card**, the first building block of your shopping cart. It will include:

- A product name
- A product image
- A price
- A button labeled "Add to Cart"

This structure sets the foundation for future styling and functionality.

---

## To do that, you’ll learn...

- What HTML is and how it defines page structure
- How to create a basic HTML file
- How to use these HTML elements:
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
  - `<div>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<button>`

- How to use `class` and `id` attributes for styling and scripting
- How to nest elements properly and stay organized

---

## By the end of today...

Each student will have a basic HTML page that displays at least one product card, similar to:

```html
<div class="product-card">
  <img src="..." alt="Product name" class="product-image" />
  <h2>Product Name</h2>
  <p>$19.99</p>
  <button class="add-to-cart-button">Add to Cart</button>
</div>
```

And this will be wrapped inside a product grid container:

```html
<div class="product-grid">
  <!-- product cards go here -->
</div>
```

## Instructor Notes

### Setup

- Students should create a folder with:
  - `index.html`
  - `styles.css` (leave empty for now)
  - `script.js` (leave empty for now)

This week focuses only on `index.html`.

### Instructor Live Coding Goals

- Build a single product card from scratch, explaining each tag
- Emphasize semantic structure and visual hierarchy
- Encourage questions about nesting and element purpose

### 1:1 Mentor Goals

- Every student completes one working product card
- Reinforce best practices:
  - Use of consistent indentation
  - Proper nesting of tags
  - Use of `class` for styling hooks

- If students finish early:
  - Add a second card
  - Customize product details

### Wrap-up and What’s Next

Close the session by reinforcing:

- HTML is the backbone of every web page
- We now have structure, next week we’ll make it visually appealing with **CSS**

Preview:

> “Next week, you’ll style your product cards to look like real store items using CSS. The product grid will come to life.”
