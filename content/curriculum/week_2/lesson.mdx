# Week 2: Style Your Product Card with CSS

## Today you’ll build...

A **styled product grid** that looks more like an online store. You’ll take last week’s product card and improve how it looks and how it’s laid out on the page.

By the end of this session, your product cards will:

- Appear side by side
- Have clean spacing and padding
- Use fonts, colors, and images that are easier to read

---

## To do that, you’ll learn...

- How to link a CSS file to an HTML page
- How to write basic CSS rules with:
  - Selectors (`.product-card`, `.product-image`, etc.)
  - Properties like `color`, `padding`, `border-radius`, `font-size`

- How to use `display: flex` to make a responsive product grid
- How to keep CSS organized by grouping related styles

---

## By the end of today...

Each student will have a styled product grid that looks something like:

```html
<div class="product-grid">
  <div class="product-card">
    <img src="..." class="product-image" />
    <h2>Product Name</h2>
    <p>$19.99</p>
    <button class="add-to-cart-button">Add to Cart</button>
  </div>
  <!-- Add another product if time allows -->
</div>
```

With styles like:

```css
.product-grid {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 20px;
  justify-content: center;
}

.product-card {
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 15px;
  width: 250px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

## Instructor Notes

### Setup

- Students should reuse their project folder from Week 1
- Ensure `index.html` includes the link to the `styles.css` file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```

### Instructor Live Coding Goals

- Demonstrate how to write CSS rules in `styles.css`
- Style `.product-card` and `.product-grid` step-by-step
- Emphasize class-based styling and how styles apply to multiple elements

### 1:1 Mentor Goals

- Every student links their CSS file successfully
- Students style at least one product card to match the design
- Encourage experimenting with:
  - Background colors
  - Border radius
  - Button colors and hover states

- If students finish early:
  - Style multiple cards
  - Adjust spacing and layout

### Wrap-up and What’s Next

End by reinforcing:

- CSS makes your HTML look good — structure and style now go hand-in-hand
- You now have the start of a product catalog

Preview:

> “Next week, we’ll add the **shopping cart** section to your page and begin setting up the space where items will be added later.”
