## tech2elevate's Goal

Our overall goal is to facilitate and encourage access to STEM programs to High School students in underserved communities in the Minneapolis metropolitan area. The program relies on software professionals volunteering their time to guide students through a structured, easily accessible, practical and hands-on CS fundamentals course.

## Target Partnership with Sisters-N-Technology

On most Friday afternoons, Target Tech mentors head to Hiawatha Collegiate High School in South Minneapolis to teach a group of awesome kids about coding and mentor them on education and careers. With every visit, we see our connections with the students and teachers growing stronger. Hiawatha Collegiate High School’s student body comprises 71% economically disadvantaged individuals, with 88% identifying as Hispanic and 10% as Black or African American. We’re also partnering with a great outreach program called Sisters-N-Technology that is focused on bringing technology to under served youth.

Our Target Tech mentors have evolved the program to now include a formal curriculum and weekly lessons with hands-on activities. At the end of the 8-week program, the students head to Target Northern Campus where they have a tour of the campus and the Guest Experience Center, enjoy a free lunch, and demonstrate what they’ve learned to their mentors and peers. Each year, we also present the students with a refurbished Target laptop they can use to continue their learning and development journey!

### Sisters-N-Technology Program Focus & Scope

The mission of Sisters-N-Technology is to engage young women in computer science and related IT fields. We are the only after school program in Minneapolis Public Schools that focuses on coding and STEM and are proud to be the 1st computer technology High School program in Minneapolis Public Schools. Sisters-N-Technology gives young women the technology skills they need to be successful in the classroom and beyond.
