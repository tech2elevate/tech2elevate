## ðŸ”§ Technologies

- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for JavaScript but with types
- [nextra](https://nextra.site) for making websites with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) & [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)

## ðŸ“‹ Getting Started

First, you need to make sure that you're running the correct node version, by running the following command:

```
nvm use
```

Then make sure you have `pnpm` installed, by running the following command:

```
corepack enable && corepack prepare
```

Before running any command you need to install dependencies. Do this by running the following command:

```
pnpm install
```

Finally, you can now run everything, by running the following command:

```
pnpm dev
```

## ðŸ¤¨ FAQ

1. After running `pnpm dev`, the search is not working as expected, is something wrong?
   - The search is mostly dependent on Next.JS's static output which is not available when running `pnpm dev`. To test the search feature locally, you can run `pnpm build` and then `pnpm preview` which will allow you to see that the search is working as expected.
2. I want to change the port for `pnpm dev`?
   - You can pass `-p [port]`, for example `pnpm dev -p 5000`
